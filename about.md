Currently the CTO and a data scientist at <a href="http://www.cheaperthandirt.com">Cheaper Than Dirt!</a>, I seem to spend way too much time learning about and putting to good use the emerging ideas in large scale computing.

I'm one of the co-authors of a book on Microsoft's Entity Framework. The second edition is available on Amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Entity-Framework-Recipes-Brian-Driscoll/dp/1430257881/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1434567321&sr=8-1&keywords=entity+framework+recipes">Entity Framework 6 Recipes</a> and the 
first edition is available on Amazon as well <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Entity-Framework-4-0-Recipes-Problem-Solution/dp/1430227036/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1434567321&sr=8-2&keywords=entity+framework+recipes">Entity Framework 4.0 Recipes: A Problem-Solution Approach</a>.
 
### The Reactive Approach

Scala, Spark, and Akka are some of the interesting technologies in the Reactive approach to large scale
distributed systems architecture.  Reactive systems are responsive, resilient, elastic, and message driven.  To
learn more about the Reactive design concepts see the <a href="http://reactivemanifesto.org">Reactive Manifesto</a>.
